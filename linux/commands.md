### ACL:

* Access control list is an extra layer of permissions for files/dir systems.
* We can assign these roles to a specific user/group.
* Commands to assign ACL commands
```
* setfacl -m(modify) u:user(replace g:group for group):rwx "path of the file" (To set file permissions)
* setfacl -dm "entry" "path of the dir" (To allow all files or directories to inherit ACL entries form the directory it is within)
* setfacl -x u:user "path" (To remove a specific entry)
* setfacl -b "path of the file" (To remove all users)
NOTE: 
1) As we assign the ACL permissions to a file/directories it adds + sign at the end of the permission when we run ls -ltr.
2) Setting W Permission with ACL does not allow to remove a file. 
* getfacl (To get existing file permissions)
```
### Text Processors Commands <u>(Powerful Commands)</u>:

* cut
* awk
* grep
* sort/uniq
* wc
* Compare files diff/cmp
* compress and uncompress (tar,gzip,gunzip)
* Truncate file size (truncate)
* Combining and splitting files
